### Summary of the Project:
Our team plans on implementing an AI that focuses on combat given a certain range and variety of monsters. (Ex. One Zombie and One Creeper) Given an array of monsters and a randomly generated weapon (Ex. Bow and Arrow), it will choose which enemy to kill first, calculate the optimal range to attack the monster, generate a path towards or away from the monster, and effectively fight the group. The overall goal of this AI is to apply it to other games and provide a companion that can assist players when fighting larger groups of enemies.

### AI/ML Algorithms:
We plan on Deep Learning, more specifically, Neural Networks to make decisions on what enemy to fight first and what would be the best order to fight the enemies in.

### Evaluation Plan:
The success of the project will be determined by the following parameters:

- The amount of times the AI dies fighting a single set of enemies.
- The amount of time the AI takes to kill a certain set of enemies. 
- The amount of time the AI is able to survive (without dying) fighting a consecutive set of enemies.
- Whether the AI is able to surpass the score of human players. 

With the base score of 0 kills and 0 deaths, we expect to improve the combat efficiency of the AI by testing in various environments with a varying density as well as difficulty of enemies. We will be observing the progress of the AI in all sets of environments to verify whether the AI learns to fight and win.
